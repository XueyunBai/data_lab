"""Part 1: Lists as Tables
Each row is a list: [id, name, school, credits]
Schema is implicit — your code depends on correct indexes.

# columns: [id, name, school, credits]

# TODO 1: Print all student names (one per line)

# TODO 2: Print only the students in GSAS (id and name)

# TODO 3: Print students with credits > 30 (name and credits)

# TODO 4: Insert a new student row for: id=5, name='Eve', school='CAS', credits=22

# TODO 5: Update Bob’s credits to 30

# Reflection (answer in a comment):
# TODO: What breaks if we insert a new column at position 2?
